## Agile Methodology
**GitHub Project Management**

For project management within the team GitHub Projects was used to assign each member of the teams tasks to complete. You an see the Kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/phillywhitty/projects/7). 

## Development and Deployment

**CREATE A DATABASE ON ELEPHANTSQL**


**Creating The Repository**
 1. On the browser head over to the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template).
 2. Click on the green "Use this template button".
 3. Click on "create a new repository".
 4. The user will be taken to a new page to create the repository.
 5. In the box titled "repository name" enter an appropriate name (for this hackathon cupid_devils was used).
 6. There is an optional description box if you wish to give a bit more detail to your repository.
 7. Then Click on the green "create repository" and Github will create the new repository.
 
**Forking the Repository** 
 - Github can also be used to fork a repository.
	 - This can create a copy of the repository which can be edited without effecting the main repository branch.
		 - The steps to fork the repository can be done as follows:
		 1. When in the "[cupids_devil" main repository]( https://github.com/phillywhitty/cupid_devils) click on the "Fork" tab located at the top right hand corner.
		 2. Click on "create a new fork"
		 3. You will be sent to another page to name your forked repository.
		 4. Once named click create fork and you will have a copy of the repository that you can now access and change without affecting the original main repository.

**Deploying on Heroku**
1. Log into your Heroku account and create a new app:
<details>
<summary> Create an new app on Heroku.</summary>
</details>

2. On the next Screen, choose an app name and where the app should be hosted then click "**Create app**".
<details>
<summary>Choose Name and Region on Heroku.</summary>
</details>

3. In your app go to the "**Deploy**" tab and then click "**GitHub**".
<details>
<summary> Search for your repo on Heroku. </summary>
</details>

4. Once Clicked a new section will open. Check that the account is correct and search for your repo name and then click "**Connect**".
<details>
<summary> Connect your repo with Heroku </summary>
</details>

5. Now as a user you need to make some setting changes within the app. Go to the "**Settings**" tab and click on "**Reveal Config Vars**".
<details>
<summary> Config Vars Heroku </summary>
</details>

6.  Once clicked a new Section will open. Add your settings from your  `env.py`  file to the  **KEY**  and  **VALUE**  field.  **Click Add**. Repeat this for every config var you need to have and also add the ones which are for Heroku only.
